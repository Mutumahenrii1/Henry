<h1>POEMS OF THE YEAR</h1>
<h2>
  THE SOUND OF FREEDOM</h2>
<p>


In the depths of silence, where hearts yearn to be free, Resides a symphony, a sacred melody, A sound that echoes through the corridors of time, Unleashing grace divine, an anthem so suwhole.</p>

 <p> It begins with a whisper, a gentle breeze, A still, small voice that brings us to our knees. It's the hallelujahs that rise from broken souls, A chorus of redemption that makes us whole.</p>

 <p>The sound of freedom in Christianity, Is more than words written in a sacred decree. It's a symphony of love, a heavenly score, That fills the air and leaves us longing for more.</p>

  <p>It's the sound of chains breaking, shattered to the ground, As grace and mercy in triumph resound. It's the cry of forgiveness, reaching deep within, Setting captives free, releasing us from sin.</p>

 <p>It's the sound of worship, lifting hearts on high, An offering of praise, reaching towards the sky. It's the rhythm of hope, a song that never dies, A melody of joy, lighting up our eyes.</p>

  <p>It's the sound of healing, restoring broken hearts, Mending every wound, embracing every part. It's the anthem of peace, calming raging storms, A symphony of comfort that transforms.</p>

  <p>It's the sound of love, unconditional and pure, A melody that's everlasting, forever to endure. It's the voice of the Savior, calling us by name, Inviting us to join in His eternal acclaim.</p>

  <p>So let us raise our voices, let the sound be heard, For in the sound of freedom, every soul is stirred. Let it echo through the ages, let it resonate, A symphony of faith, a song that cannot wait.</p>

  <p>For the sound of freedom in Christianity, Is a melody of grace that sets the captive free. It's a song of redemption, a love that knows no end, The sweetest sound of all, our Savior and our friend.</p>
